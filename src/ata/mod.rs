All things ATA.

* Import [`ATADevice`](trait.ATADevice.html) to start sending ATA commands to the [`Device`](../device/index.html).
* Use [`data` module](data/index.html) to parse various low-level structures found in ATA command replies.
* Import traits from porcelain modules (currently that's just [`misc`](misc/index.html)) to do typical tasks without needing to compose commands and parse responses yourself.

/*
One might notice there's no linux support here. There's a couple of reasons for that:
- generally available ioctls like HDIO_DRIVE_{CMD,TASK} are too specialized and unsuitable for writing generic code
- more generic ioctl, HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE is not available if kernel is not built with CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL (and it is indeed absent in modern mainstream distros)
- all HDIO_* ioctls are full of quirks like conditionally pre-filled and masked registers (see Documentation/ioctl/hdio.txt)
- CONFIG_IDE is disabled for a really long time in modern distros, and support for most of HDIO_* ioctls is absent from libata in favour of issuing ATA commangs through SG_IO, which is already covered in scsi module of this crate
